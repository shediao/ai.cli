SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n 3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n 4. Special operations:\n * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n"
